To do so you will parse the elements in the OSM XML file, transforming them from document format to tabular format, thus making it possible to write to .csv files.  These csv files can then easily be imported to a SQL database as tables.\n",

    "- Use iterparse to iteratively step through each top level element in the XML\n",
    "- Shape each element into several data structures using a custom function\n",
    "- Utilize a schema and validation library to ensure the transformed data is in the correct format\n",
    "- Write each data structure to the appropriate .csv files\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already provided the code needed to load the data, perform iterative parsing and write the output to csv files. Your task is to complete the shape_element function that will transform each element into the correct format. To make this process easier we've already defined a schema (see the schema.py file in the last code tab) for the .csv files and the eventual tables. Using the cerberus library we can validate the output against this schema to ensure it is correct.\n",
